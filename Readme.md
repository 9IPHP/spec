# Evolving Specs about Programming

The purpose of this organization is to be a place where best practices about all apsects of programming can be collected, discussed, fleshed out, and distilled into principles.

For any particular topic, just open up an issue in one of these repos and outline your thoughts. Another repo can be created too if that helps. Show example snippets of code and all that to make it easier for everyone to follow along.

The only thing to keep in mind is, have an open mind, listen to what others have to say and really try to see the world from their perspective before you make a decision about something. It's okay to change your mind too.

In the long run, this will result in an archive of all the thought processes and decisions we went through to arrive at the best practices, something that is missing in the programming world. Many things are being reinvented all the time, and rethought from the ground up, when the vast majority of that time and energy can be saved if we just read the "specification" that others have already figured out.
